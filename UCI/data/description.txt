======== Description ==========

Overview:

The are 9 network capture datasets:
	ARP MitM: ARP Man-in-the-Middle attack between a camera & DVR
	SSDP Flood: SSDP Flooding Attack against the DVR Server
	OS Scan: NMAP OS Scan of the subnet
	Active Wiretap: A bridged Raspberry Pi placed between all cameras and the DVR server
	SYN Flooding: A SYN DoS attack against a camera
	Fuzzing: A Fuzzing Attack against DVR's webserver's cgi
	Video Injection: A MitM video content injection attack into a camera's live stream
	SSL Renegotiation: A DoS attack against an SSL enabled camera
	Mirai: The initial infection and propagation of the Mirai malware (**on a diffrent [IoT] network**)
-For more deatils on the attacks themselves, please refer to the paper.


Organization:

-Each attack dataset is located in a seperate directory
-The directory contains three files:
	<Attack>_pcap.pcapng	:	A raw pcap capture of the origional N packets. The packets have been truncated to 200 bytes for privacy reasons.
	<Attack>_dataset.csv	:	An N-by-M matrix of M-sized feature vectors, each decribing the packet and the context of that packet's channel (see paper).
	<Attack>_labels.csv		:	An N-by-1 vector of 0-1 values which indicate whether each packet in <Attack>_pcap.pcapng (and <Attack>_dataset.csv) is malicous ('1') or not ('0'). For the Man-in-middle-Attacks, all packets which have passed through the MitM are marked as '1'.
-Every attack dataset begins with benign traffic, and then at some point (1) the attacker connects to the network and (2) initiiates the given attack.
