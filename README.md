# Fermi-Dirac based Ensemble Learning (FiDEL)

an ensemble learning algorithm that uses the calibrated nature of the output probability of possibly very different classifiers in an unsupervised setting well-suited for problems when we have scant data at hand to apply supervised ensemble learning.

## Installation

required packages: kernlab, lme4, coin, modeltools, arm, party, caret, earth, RSNNS, C50, glmnet

Use R-Studio and load `FiDEL.Rproj` and build/install
